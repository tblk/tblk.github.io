I rely on the installation that comes with Linux.

I installed the following packages with pipe :

- pandas
- folium
- plotly
- jupyterlab
- geopandas

If a serious dependency issue arises, use : pip-autoremove packagename. It will also uninstall all the dependancies. And install again with miniconda.

Note : I had to uninstall harlequin due to a dependency conflict with jupyter.

Jupyter lab doesn't come with an icon, I have one because I installed Jupyter Desktop and then uninstalled it. It created a Desktop configuration file in ~/.local/share/applications and added and icon to ~/local/share/icons/...
