I rely on the installation that comes with Linux.

I installed the following packages with pip :

- pandas
- folium
- plotly
- jupyterlab
- geopandas
- polars
- duckdb

If a serious dependency issue arises, use : `pip-autoremove <packagename>`. It will also uninstall all the dependancies. And install again with miniconda. Or use venv.

Note : I had to uninstall harlequin due to a dependency conflict with jupyter.

Jupyter lab doesn't come with an icon, I have one because I installed Jupyter Desktop and then uninstalled it. It created a Desktop configuration file in ~/.local/share/applications and added and icon to ~/local/share/icons/...
