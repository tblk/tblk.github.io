I rely on the installation that comes with Linux.

I installed the following packages with pipe :

- pandas
- folium
- plotly
- jupyterlab

If a serious dependency issue arises, use : pip-autoremove packagename. It will also uninstall all the dependancies. And install again with miniconda.

Note : I had to uninstall harlequin due to a dependency conflict with jupyter.
